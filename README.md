# Topview Coding test

This is the coding test for a job at top view. The code uses Bootstrap and jQuery to create a responsive website that can show a limited number of data points from https://blockchain.info/ticker. Bootstrap and jQuery were used in the interest of time constraints. 

The test can be accessed at http://topview.herokuapp.com/.

http://topview.herokuapp.com/ajax.php  is the api link to get data from the Ticker. You can pass it a limit of how many results to return.
